# **OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming**

- Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.
- a class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.
- When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the variables and methods from the class.
- A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
